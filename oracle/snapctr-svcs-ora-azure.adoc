This solution provides overview and details for Oracle database backup, restore, clone using NetApp SnapCenter SaaS using BlueXP console.

== Purpose

SnapCenter Services is the SaaS version of the classic SnapCenter database management UI tool that is available through the NetApp BlueXP cloud management console. It is an integral part of the NetApp cloud-backup, data-protection offering for databases such as Oracle and HANA running on Azure NetApp Files. This SaaS-based service simplifies traditional SnapCenter standalone server deployment that generally requires a Windows server operating in a Windows domain environment.  

In this documentation, we demonstrate how you can set up SnapCenter Services to backup, restore, and clone Oracle databases deployed on Azure NetApp Files volumes and Azure compute instances. It is very easy to setup data protection for Oracle database deployed on Azure NetApp Files with web based BlueXP user interface. 

This solution addresses the following use cases:

* Database backup with snapshots for Oracle databases hosted in Azure NetApp Files and Azure VMs
* Oracle database recovery in the case of a failure  
* Fast cloning of primary databases for dev, test environments or other use cases  

== Audience

This solution is intended for the following audiences:

* The DBA who manages Oracle databases running on Azure NetApp Files storage
* The solution architect who is interested in testing Oracle database backup, restore, and clone in Azure
* The storage administrator who supports and manages the Azure NetApp Files storage
* The application owner who owns applications that are deployed to Azure NetApp Files storage and Azure VMs 

== Solution test and validation environment

The testing and validation of this solution was performed in a lab environment that might not match the final deployment environment. For more information, see the section <<Key factors for deployment consideration>>.

=== Key factors for deployment consideration

* *Connector to be deployed in the same virtual network / subnet as databases and Azure NetApp Files.* When possible, the connector should be deployed in the same Azure virtual networks and resource groups, which enables connectivity to the Azure NetApp Files storage and the Azure compute instances.

* *An Azure user account or Active Directory service principle created at Azure portal for SnapCenter connector.* Deploying a BlueXP Connector requires specific permissions to create and configure a virtual machine and other compute resources, to configure networking, and to get access to the Azure subscription. It also requires permissions to later create roles and permissions for the Connector to operate. Create a custom role in Azure with permissions and assign to the user account or service principle. Review the following link for details:link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-set-up-permissions-azure.html#set-up-permissions-to-create-the-connector-from-bluexp[Set up Azure permissions^]. 

* *A ssh key pair created in the Azure resource group.* The ssh key pair is assigned to the Azure VM user for logging into the connector host and also the database VM host for deploying and executing a plug-in. BlueXP console UI uses the ssh key to deploy SnapCenter service plugin to database host for one-step plugin installation and application host database discovery.

* *A credential added to the BlueXP console setting.* To add Azure NetApp Files storage to the BlueXP working environment, a credential that grants permissions to access Azure NetApp Files from the BlueXP console needs to be set up in the BlueXP console setting. 

* *java-11-openjdk installed on the Azure VM database instance host.* SnapCenter service installation requires java version 11. It needs to be installed on application host before plugin deployment attempt. 

== Solution deployment

There is extensive NetApp documentation with a broader scope to help you protect your cloud-native application data. The goal of this documentation is to provide step-by-step procedures that cover SnapCenter Service deployment with the BlueXP console to protect your Oracle database deployed on an Azure NetApp Files storage and an Azure compute instance. 

To get started, complete the following steps:

* Read the general instructions link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-backup-recovery/[Protect your cloud native applications data^] and the sections related to Oracle and Azure NetApp Files.

* Watch the following video walkthrough

=== Prerequisites for SnapCenter service deployment

[%collapsible%open]
====
Deployment requires the following prerequisites.

. A primary Oracle database server on an Azure VM instance with an Oracle database fully deployed and running. 

. An Azure NetApp Files storage service capacity pool deployed in Azure that has capacity to meet the database storage needs listed in hardware component section.

. A secondary database server on an Azure VM instance that can be used for testing the cloning of an Oracle database to an alternate host for the purpose of supporting a dev/test workload or any use cases that requires a full data set of production Oracle database.

. For additional information for Oracle database deployment on Azure NetApp Files and Azure compute instance, see link:azure-ora-nfile-usecase.html[Oracle Database Deployment and Protection on Azure NetApp Files^].

=== Onboarding to BlueXP preparation

[%collapsible%open]
====
. Use the link link:https://console.bluexp.netapp.com/[NetApp BlueXP] to sign up for BlueXP console access.

. Create an Azure user account or an Active Directory service principle and grant permissions with role in Azure portal for Azure connector deployment.

. To set up BlueXP to manage Azure resources, add a BlueXP credential with details of an Active Directory service principal that BlueXP can use to authenticate with Azure Active Directory (App client ID), a client secret for the service principal application (Client Secret), and the Active Directory ID for your organization (Tenant ID).

. You also need the Azure virtual network, resources group, security group, an SSH key for VM access, etc. ready for connector provisioning and database plugin installation.

. To protect database, click the three dots next to the database *Protection Status*, and then click *Assign Policy* to view the default preloaded or user defined database protection policies that can be applied to your Oracle databases. Under *Settings* - *Policies*, you have option to create your own policy with a customized backup frequency and backup data-retention window.
+
image:snapctr-svcs-bkup-001-azure.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. When you are happy with the policy configuration, you can then *Assign* your policy of choice to protect the database.
+
image:snapctr-svcs-bkup-002-azure.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. After the policy is applied, the database protection status changed to *Protected* with a green check mark. BlueXP executes the snapshot backup according to the schedule defined. In addition, *ON-Demand Backup* is available from the three-dot drop down menu as shown below. 
+
image:snapctr-svcs-bkup-003-azure.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. From *Job Monitoring* tab, backup job details can be viewed. Our test results showed that it took about 4 minutes to backup an Oracle database about 1.6 TiB.
+
image:snapctr-svcs-bkup-004-azure.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. From three-dot drop down menu *View Details*, you can view the backup sets created from snapshot backup.
+
image:snapctr-svcs-bkup-005-azure.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]

. Database backup details include the *Backup Name*, *Backup Type*, *SCN*, *RMAN Catalog*, and *Backup Time*. A backup set contains application-consistent snapshots for data volume and log volume respectively. A log volume snapshot takes place right after a database data volume snapshot. You could apply a filter if you are looking for a particular backup in the backup list.
+

+
image:snapctr-svcs-restore-006-azure.png["Screenshot showing this step in the GUI."]
====

=== Oracle database clone 

[%collapsible%open]
====
Database clone procedures are similar to restore but to an alternate Azure VM with identical Oracle software stack pre-installed and configured.

[NOTE]

Ensure that your Azure NetApp File storage has sufficient capacity for a cloned database the same size as the primary database to be cloned. The alternate Azure VM has been added to *Applications*.   

. Click the three-dot drop down menu for the particular database to be cloned in *Applications*, then click *Restore* to initiate clone workflow.
+
image:snapctr-svcs-restore-001-azure.png["Figure showing input/output dialog or representing written content"]

. Select the *Restore Point* and check the *Restore to alternate location*. 
+
image:snapctr-svcs-clone-001-azure.png["Figure showing input/output dialog or representing written content"]

. In the next *Configuration* page, set alternate *Host*, new database *SID*, and *Oracle Home* as configured at alternate Azure VM.
+
image:snapctr-svcs-clone-002-azure.png["Figure showing input/output dialog or representing written content"]

. Review *General* page shows the details of cloned database such as SID, alternate host, data file locations, recovery scope etc.
+
image:snapctr-svcs-clone-003-azure.png["Figure showing input/output dialog or representing written content"]

. Review *Database parameters* page shows the details of cloned database configuration as well as some database parameters setting.
+
image:snapctr-svcs-clone-004-azure.png["Figure showing input/output dialog or representing written content"]

. Monitor the cloning job status from the *Job Monitoring* tab, we observed that it took 8 minutes to clone a 1.6 TiB Oracle database.
+
image:snapctr-svcs-clone-005-azure.png["Figure showing input/output dialog or representing written content"]

. Validate the cloned database in BlueXP *Applications* page that showed the cloned database was immediately registered with BlueXP.
+
image:snapctr-svcs-clone-006-azure.png["Figure showing input/output dialog or representing written content"]

. Validate the cloned database on the Oracle Azure VM that showed the cloned database was running as expected.
+
image:snapctr-svcs-clone-007-azure.png["Figure showing input/output dialog or representing written content"]

This completes the demonstration of an Oracle database backup, restore, and clone in Azure with NetApp BlueXP console using SnapCenter Service.
